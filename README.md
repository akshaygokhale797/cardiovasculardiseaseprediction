## **Cardiovascular Disease Prediction**
A web-based tool and machine learning model to predict cardiovascular disease risk based on user inputs.

### **üìå Project Overview**
This project provides an interface to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease using a **machine learning model**. Users can enter their age, gender, cholesterol level, glucose level, and other health-related factors, and the model will provide a prediction.

### **üîß Features**
- **Web Interface:** Built with HTML, CSS for easy data entry.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trained using `XGBoost` to classify cardiovascular disease risk.
- **Data Processing:** Feature engineering and transformations applied to the dataset.
- **Interactive Form:** Users can input their health details and get an instant prediction.

### **üöÄ Setup Instructions**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cardiovascular-disease-prediction.git
cd cardiovascular-disease-prediction
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Web Application**
If this project includes a Flask API or frontend, add the command to start it:
```bash
python app.py  # Modify as per your entry file
```

### **üìä Dataset**
- The dataset used for training the model consists of patient records with various health metrics.
- The data includes **age, gender, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more.**
- **[Link to Dataset (if applicable)]** or mention **data preprocessing techniques**.

### **üìö Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Python, Flask (if applicable)
- **Machine Learning:** XGBoost, Scikit-Learn, Pandas
- **Data Processing:** Feature engineering, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoding

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Notes**
- **The model should not be used for medical decisions.** It is a **proof of concept** and should not replace professional medical advice.
